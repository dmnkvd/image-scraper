# Brainstorm

What aspects are really important to me here?

I think that it's quite important to download:

- the images
- their sources
  (what websites do they appear on, that's indexed in the search results)
- time of scraping

The installation can show:

- the sources of these image streams
- the quantification of them
- the description of what the image shows
